# Project Title

This repository contains two projects: a donation platform for refugees and a landing page for a volunteering organization targeting young artists.

The donation platform simplifies the process with a sign-in-free experience, allowing donors to post items in just three clicks. Contact information can be optionally provided for direct communication and arranging item pickup.

The landing page promotes the volunteering organization's unique approach, attracting young artists for collaborative projects. It serves as a recruitment tool, showcasing past projects and encouraging contributions.
